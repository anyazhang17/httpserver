# Assignment 4 directory

This directory contains source code and other files for Assignment 4.

httpserver.c implements a multi-threaded HTTP server using thread-pool design.
The server uses POSIX threads (pthreads) to implement multi-threading.
It also uses structs such as a queue, rwlock, and hashmap. 
I used TA's pseudocode, Stack Overflow, and Google to do this assignment.
I used ChatGPT to create hashmap.c.
